Background
----------
The previous version of CAS-LPPE/PM has been updated to support CAS 3.5
and its built-in LPPE extensions. More documentation will be forthcoming.
Thanks for your patience.

Very Brief Quickstart
---------------------
1. Check out this Maven overlay project from github.
2. Copy src/main/webapp/WEB-INF/cas.properties.example to cas.properties
3. Edit it for your setup
4. mvn clean package
5. If all goes well, the webapp will be in target/cas.war.

There will be more documentation here in a few days.
